Operator Services
=================

In kangaru, there are built-in services that their purpose is to make specific operations on the container.
They help encapsulate which jobs on the container a class is able to do.

They generally wrap the container and allow only an operation to do with the container.

## Container

There's a service called `kgr::container_service`. It's a special service that inject a reference to the container itself.

You can call it directly, use it in invoke or as dependency:

```c++
struct Type {
    kgr::container& container;
};

struct TypeService : kgr::service<Type, kgr::dependency<kgr::container_service>> {};

kgr::container container1;
kgr::container& container2 = container1.service<container_service>();

assert(&container1 == &container2); // passes, both are the same

container1.invoke([&](kgr::container& container3, Type type) {
    // Both passes
    assert(&container1 == &container3);
    assert(&container3 == &type.container);
});
```

## Fork

There's a service called `kgr::container_service`. It's a service that will call `container.fork()`, and then inject the fork.

You can call it directly, use it in invoke or as dependency:

```c++
kgr::container container1;

// equivalent to:
// kgr::container container2 = container1.fork();
kgr::container container2 = container1.service<fork_service>();

container.invoke([](kgr::container fork) {
    // fork is a forked container, we received by value.
});
```

The fork service has another version called `kgr::filtered_fork_service<F>`, where `F` is a predicate to filter services:

```c++
kgr::container container1;

// equivalent to:
// kgr::container container2 = container1.fork<kgr::none_of<Service1, Service2>>();
// Every service from container1 are observed by the fork except Service1 and Service2
kgr::container container2 = container1.service<filtered_fork_service<kgr::none_of<Service1, Service2>>>();
```

## Generator

A generator is an object that it's purpose is to create a specific service. It's kind of a factory that internally uses the container.
The class `generator<T>` is a template class where `T` is a service definition.

The `generator` class has a service definition named `generator_service`.

It has one member function: `operator(...)`. This function is equivalent to calling the `service<T>(...)` function on the container.
It will forward every arguments to the service function.

Here's an example:
    
```c++
// SceneService is a non-single service.
kgr::generator<SceneService> sceneGenerator = container.service<kgr::generator_service<SceneService>>();

auto scene1 = sceneGenerator();
auto scene2 = sceneGenerator();
auto scene3 = sceneGenerator("special parameter");
```

There's another version of the generator for a forked container. It's called `forked_generator`, and it's definition `forked_generator_service`.

## Invoker

As it's name says, this class serves the purpose of calling the `invoke` function from the container.
Why using `kgr::invoker` when you can just use `container.invoke`?
Because again, it encapsulate what you can do with the container, and express your intent of only calling `invoke` on it.

Here's a code snippet using `kgr::invoker`:

```c++
int send_message(MessageBus&, Window&, double timeout);

kgr::invoker invoker = container.service<kgr::invoker_service>();

invoker(send_message, 10); // calls send_message with 10 as it's timeout
```

When using the default invoker, you can send a map as the first parameter of the function object. This can be used to specify which map to use for each call:

```c++
struct custom_map;
kgr::invoker invoke = container.service<kgr::invoker_service>();

invoke(kgr::map<custom_map>{}, send_message, 10);
```

If sending the map as first parameter is not the ideal, there is a way to specify which maps to use in advance. This is effectively a curried `kgr::invoker`:

```c++
kgr::mapped_invoker<kgr::map<MyMap1, MyMap2>> invoker =
    container.service<kgr::mapped_invoker_service<kgr::map<MyMap1, MyMap2>>>();
```

Also, just like the generator, another version of the invoker for a forked container is provided, called `kgr::forked_invoker`, and it's definition `kgr::forked_invoker_service`.
    
## Lazy

The lazy class is used to represent a service that will be constructed later. The type `lazy<T>` takes a service definition as parameter.
That service definition will be used with the container to instantiate your object.

The lazy class has the dereference operator `*` and the arrow operator `->` to access the contained object.
Additionally, it has a `get()` method that returns a reference to the contained object.

The object is first instantiated when the first access operator of function is called. The instance is then reused after.

Lazy is provided with a service definition named `lazy_service<T>` where `T` is a service definition.

You can use it like this:

```c++
// The contained 'MessageBus&' is not constructed yet.
kgr::lazy<MessageBusService> lazy_message_bus = container.service<kgr::lazy_service<MessageBusService>>();

// MessageBusService is constructed here, the operator* is used.
std::cout << *lazy_message_bus;

// The same instance is reused again and returned by operator->
lazy_message_bus->process_messages();
```

And again, there's the equivalent of lazy with a forked container, named `forked_lazy<T>` and `forked_lazy_service<T>`

## Override Range

The `v4.2.0` version added a new operator service named `kgr::override_range_service<T>` where `T` is a polymorphic service.
It injects a range of services that overrides `T`. It can be useful to iterate and do operation on a multiple services that offers the same interface.

It return a `kgr::override_range<X>` where `X` is implementation defined. 

This type should be only used to iterate on services immediately. Adding a new override in the container will invalidate the range.

Here's an example of use:

```c++
struct Base {
    virtual void print() { std::cout << "Base\n" << std::endl; }
};

struct Derived : Base {
    void print() override { std::cout << "Derived\n" << std::endl; }
};

struct BaseService : kgr::single_service<Base>, kgr::polymorphic {};
struct DerivedService : kgr::single_service<Derived>, kgr::overrides<BaseService> {};

kgr::container container{};

container.emplace<BaseService>();
container.emplace<DerivedService>();

auto base_range = container.service<kgr::override_range_service<BaseService>>();

for (Base& service : range) {
    service.print(); // prints Base and Derived
}
```

In this example, we defined two services, one overrides the other. Then we add them both in the container.
After that we ask the container for a range of every service that overrides `BaseService`. The base service instance is included in the range.

The loop will pass over both services and will call print.

## Conclusion

While you can use the container directly everywhere, you can also be more fined grained over what a particular piece of code should be able to do with the container. It eventually reduces coupling in your code and helps to express your intent with other programmers about what you will do with the container.

Also, some special built in services expose features of the container. They are great tools that can help simplify your code using containers.
